<h3><strong>What is exactly Website Development :</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Web design, web content creation, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration are all part of the web development process.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Rather, the programming and coding part is primarily concerned, which is the main reason the website works. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It refers to web pages, including web design, web programming, web publishing, and data base management bits and elements.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most web developers use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript to develop websites. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We develop everything from basic and simple websites to complex web-based applications and social media platforms and from many online shopping websites to CMS systems.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p> When users enter data, fill out forms, or make a purchase, the browser sends that request to the backend (the server-side), which returns the data as frontend code for the web page to comprehend, interpret, and make visible to you. </p>
